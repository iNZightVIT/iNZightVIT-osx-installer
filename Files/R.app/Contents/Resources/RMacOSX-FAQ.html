<h2 class="chapter">1 Introduction</h2>

<p>This document contains a user guide to the <span class="sc">R.app</span> version of <acronym>R</acronym>, and
information on using <acronym>R</acronym> on OS X which supplements the main <acronym>R</acronym>
manuals.  As from <acronym>R</acronym> 3.0.0 most of the information has been moved to
those manuals, the latest versions of which can be found at
<a href="http://cran.r-project.org/manuals.html">http://cran.r-project.org/manuals.html</a>.

   <p>In this document <acronym>R</acronym> refers to the core, command-line-based <acronym>R</acronym> system
while <span class="sc">R.app</span> refers to the GUI-based Mac OS application that controls
the underlying <acronym>R</acronym>.

   <p>This `R for Mac OS X FAQ' is rather incomplete at the moment and requires
contributions from users.  Anything specific to the R language can be
found in the main R-FAQ (see
<a href="http://cran.r-project.org/doc/FAQ/R-FAQ.html">http://cran.r-project.org/doc/FAQ/R-FAQ.html</a>).  Please send any
requests/questions you would like answers to the
<a href="https://stat.ethz.ch/mailman/listinfo/r-sig-mac">R-SIG-Mac</a>
mailing list (after subscribing) as well as comments on this FAQ.

   <p>The last section of this document contains the most frequently asked
questions that don't fit strictly into any of the categories above &ndash; it
is usually a good idea to always look into that section if your issue
doesn't fit any of the above or was not answered in one of the specific
sections. <em>Always read this FAQ before asking for help on
R-SIG-Mac!</em>

<h3 class="section">1.1 How many versions of R for Mac OS X?</h3>

<p>There is only one version of R for Mac OS X.  However, <acronym>R</acronym> on Mac OS X
can be used either on the command-line as on other Unix systems, or via
the <span class="sc">R.app</span> GUI (see <a href="#R_002eapp">R.app</a>).  The second approach is mostly
preferred by Macintosh users.

   <p>Prior to <acronym>R</acronym> 3.0.0 there were separate 32- and 64-bit version of
<span class="sc">R.app</span>: nowadays only 64-bit builds are supported in binary form.

<h3 class="section">1.3 How can R for Mac OS X be obtained and installed?</h3>

<p><acronym>R</acronym> is available on <acronym>CRAN</acronym> in the form of an Installer package
containing the R framework and the <span class="sc">R.app</span> GUI. The package is usually
named <samp><span class="file">R.pkg</span></samp> with an optional version number.

   <p>The installation is done by double-clicking on the Installer
package. The Installer will guide you through the necessary steps.  Note
that it will require password or login of an account with administrator
privileges.  The installation can be customized, but the default is
suitable for most users.

   <p>Snapshots of the R-patched and R-devel flavours are available at
<a href="http://r.research.att.com/">http://r.research.att.com/</a>, packaged in the same way.

   <p>Further details, including uninstallation and building <acronym>R</acronym> from the
sources, are in the `R Installation and Administration Manual'.

</ul>

<p><span class="sc">R.app</span> is the name of the GUI for Mac OS X that was introduced in R
2.0.0. It appears as an icon labeled <em>R</em>, but to avoid confusion
with general <acronym>R</acronym>, we prefer to use the name as it appears when using
<em>Get Info</em> on the GUI: <span class="sc">R.app</span> This stands for <em>R
application</em>.

   <p>Internally <span class="sc">R.app</span> is a Cocoa program (hence written in Objective C)
which links to embedded <acronym>R</acronym> installed as a framework.

<!-- Historically there were two more GUIs for Mac OS X: @emph{RAqua} and @emph{Cocoa GUI bundle}. The latter was never officially released and RAqua was retired in R version 2.1, because it used legacy toolkit from the times of MacOS9. -->

<h3 class="section">2.1 How to get R.app</h3>

<p><span class="sc">R.app</span> is part of the binary distribution of R for Mac OS X available
from <acronym>CRAN</acronym>. That distribution consists of one package containing the R
framework and <span class="sc">R.app</span>.

   <p>Development versions of <span class="sc">R.app</span> are made available on daily basis in the
form of a disk image containing the <span class="sc">R.app</span> itself. See the Mac OS X
pages on <acronym>CRAN</acronym> for detail how to obtain such snapshots (currently at
<a href="http://R.research.att.com/">http://R.research.att.com/</a>).

<h3 class="section">2.2 How to install the R.app</h3>

<p><span class="sc">R.app</span> is installed the same way as the R framework, namely using
binary package provided on <acronym>CRAN</acronym>. The <samp><span class="file">bin/macosx</span></samp> directory of a
<acronym>CRAN</acronym> site contains a standard Apple installer package named
<samp><span class="file">R.pkg</span></samp> (optionally containing the version number). Download and
double-click the package icon.

   <p>Please, carefully read the note on the usage of tcltk and Fortran on the <samp><span class="file">bin/macosx</span></samp> directory of a <acronym>CRAN</acronym> site.

<h4 class="subsection">2.3.1 The Input and the Output</h4>

<p>The current design of the R Console is to have a single frame for input (user) and output (R).

</div>

<h4 class="subsection">2.3.2 Copy and Paste</h4>

<p>Copy and paste works in R as in any other Macintosh application.

   <p>If you want high resolution graphic exports, you can save the PDF format using the <em>File/Save as</em> menu item (see <a href="#Quartz-device">Quartz device</a>). Or you can use supported formats in R through <code>pdf()</code>, <code>jpeg()</code> etc. (type <code>?capabilities</code> to get more details).

Up:&nbsp;<a rel="up" accesskey="u" href="#The-R-Console">The R Console</a>

</div>

<h4 class="subsection">2.3.3 The current and startup working directories</h4>

<p>If not otherwise specified in the Preferences (see <a href="#Preferences">Preferences</a>), or if the specified path is no longer available, then the default working directory at startup is the user home. 
The working directory can be changed using the <em>setwd</em> R command or using the <em>Misc</em> menu item <em>Change working directory</em>. Finally it is possible to use a specific directory for a single <acronym>R</acronym> session by dragging a folder onto the <span class="sc">R.app</span> icon. If <span class="sc">R.app</span> is not running, this will cause <span class="sc">R.app</span> to be started in the directory corresponding to the folder dragged. The same can be achieved on the command line &ndash; for example <code>open -a R .</code> causes <span class="sc">R.app</span> to be started using the current directory as the startup working directory.

<p class="noindent">This feature is useful if you want different startup procedures defined by the <samp><span class="file">.Rprofile</span></samp>; you can
edit a <samp><span class="file">.Rprofile</span></samp> (containing you personal initialization <acronym>R</acronym> commands) in a particular directory and use
the Preferences (or any other method mentioned above) to change the startup directory. Next time you launch <samp><span class="file">R.app</span></samp> the <samp><span class="file">.Rprofile</span></samp> is read and executed by <acronym>R</acronym> at startup. This is the equivalent on Unix (or the command line) to launch <acronym>R</acronym> from different directories.

<h4 class="subsection">2.4.1 Editor</h4>

<p><span class="sc">R.app</span> provides an integrated editor for editing of R code. It sports a number of features designed to help developing code inside R. The probably most often used function is the ability to execute code directly from the editor by pressing <kbd>&lt;Command&gt;-&lt;Return&gt;</kbd>. Other features include syntax highlighting, brace-matching, code completion and function indexing.

</div>

<h4 class="subsection">2.4.2 Editor undo and line numbers</h4>

<p>The editor supports undo/redo operations on an appropriate level of granularity (used to
be all or nothing). The editor has an optional facility to show line numbers. These help with
locating error messages. The editor also responds to the 'Go to Line' Edit menu function. The
associated Preference Pane allows enabling/disabling of the line numbers, as well as setting line
number gutter width (to fit larger line numbers) and text margin width.

<h4 class="subsection">2.4.3 Editor text completion</h4>

<p>Completion of typed input (both file names and R code) in the editor is available through the Edit menu 'Complete' or by typing <kbd>&lt;Control&gt;-&lt;.&gt;</kbd> (same as is Xcode). It uses the same facilities as the console window (for compatibility the console responds to both &lt;Tab&gt; and <kbd>&lt;Control&gt;-&lt;.&gt;</kbd>).

<h4 class="subsection">2.4.4 Editor function list</h4>

<p>The editor maintains a popup list of functions defined in the edited document. The list is available in the toolbar and is updated as you type. Selecting a function from that list causes the cursor to jump to the beginning of the function.

</div>

<h4 class="subsection">2.4.5 Editor  syntax coloring</h4>

<p>The editor supports syntax-highlighting for R code. It is possible to change the syntax highlighting colors using the Syntax Color Preference Pane (see below). Starting with <span class="sc">R.app</span> version 1.17 lazy syntax highlighting is used, which means that changes influencing the entire file (such as typing a single or double quote) no longer apply to the entire file, but only a few lines. This temporary state is usually recovered by closing the quote, but in some rare instances it may persist until a change is made to the first line of the offending quote. However, lazy highlighting brings huge speedup when editing large files.

</div>

<h4 class="subsection">2.4.6 Editor (internal and external)</h4>

<p>By default, the editor used is incorporated into <span class="sc">R.app</span>, the Mac OS X GUI for R. It is a
relatively simple multi-document editor that supports the features listed above. Additionally,
two powerful commands are available to source the file being edited in its entirety (<kbd>Command-E</kbd>)
or to source the current selection to <acronym>R</acronym> (<kbd>Command-Return</kbd>). Using <acronym>R</acronym>'s <code>edit()</code> function, allows
editing of R objects or files while <acronym>R</acronym> is kept waiting for the edit session to finish.

   <p>It is possible to 'redirect' all <acronym>R</acronym> requests to an external editor, which runs
outside <span class="sc">R.app</span>. In that case, it is not possible to keep <acronym>R</acronym> waiting if <code>edit()</code> is used. Using
AppleScript it is easy to implement <kbd>Command-E</kbd> and <kbd>Command-Return</kbd> like functionality.

running will start <span class="sc">R.app</span> and set the working directory. By default
<samp><span class="file">.RData</span></samp> and the history file (default name <samp><span class="file">.Rapp.history</span></samp>)
are fetched from this working directory.  If a file is dropped on the
<span class="sc">R.app</span> icon while <span class="sc">R.app</span> is not running, <span class="sc">R.app</span> is started, the file
is either restored (if it is a saved workspace), sourced into <span class="sc">R.app</span> or
opened in the selected editor. Whether the file is opened or sourced is
specified by a Preference setting in the StartUp Preference Pane.

   <p>Note: At this point opening a file in the editor before <span class="sc">R.app</span> is finished
loading will crash <span class="sc">R.app</span>.

   <p>While <span class="sc">R.app</span> is running, drag &amp; drop of a directory updates the working
directory. Drag &amp; drop of a file sources or opens the file in the
selected editor. Double clicking on files bound to ("Open With ...") R,
if <span class="sc">R.app</span> is not running, <span class="sc">R.app</span> is started and the file is sourced or
opened in editor. If <span class="sc">R.app</span> is running, the file is opened in the
editor.

<h4 class="subsection">2.4.10 History</h4>

<p><span class="sc">R.app</span> uses history files that are (superset) compatible with history
files created by R. Multiline support remains available from inside
<span class="sc">R.app</span>. Multiline is particularly useful when using the
<kbd>&lt;Command&gt;-&lt;Return&gt;</kbd> feature while editing an R
script. Import and export allows storing and importing history from
files visible in the Mac OS Finder. Multiline is preserved. This can be
set through the StartUp Preference Panel. Default number of kept history
entries is 250. A variety of history entry cleanup modes is possible. 
At a minimum it is suggested to select "Cleanup history entries". It's
optional to select removal of duplicate entries and strip comments.

   <p>Note: Command-line <acronym>R</acronym> stores history in a file usually called
<samp><span class="file">.Rhistory</span></samp>. It is suggested to use a different name for the
<span class="sc">R.app</span> history file, and the default is <samp><span class="file">.Rapp.history</span></samp>.

   <p>Note that the functions <code>loadhistory()</code>, <code>savehistory()</code> and
hence <code>history()</code> are not currently supported in <span class="sc">R.app</span>.

<h4 class="subsection">2.4.11 Authentication and .libPaths</h4>

<p>The official <acronym>CRAN</acronym> binaries come pre-packaged in such a way that
administrator have sufficient privileges to update R and install
packages system-wide. However, the default Unix build requires
root-authentication for package installation and other administrative
tasks. As it is not feasible to run the GUI as root, we provide the
possibility to authenticate system commands issued from the GUI. The
authentication requires an administrator login and causes all subsequent
system commands to be executed as root. Use with care!

   <p>In order to allow non-administrators to maintain their own set of
packages, <span class="sc">R.app</span> optionally adds <code>~/Library/R/x.y/library</code> to the
<code>.libPaths</code> (see start-up preferences, <code>x.y</code> denotes the R
version without patch level). It is possible to use the Package
Installer to install packages either globally (admin users only) or for
the current user only.  (This is the same mechanism for personal library
directories described in the main <acronym>R</acronym> documentation, but with a location
specific to <acronym>CRAN</acronym>-like builds of <acronym>R</acronym> on OS X.)

   <p>Note that user-local packages are only used when the corresponding
preference option is enabled. The default for admin users is to use
system-wide directories, for non-admin users the personal library
directory will be used.

<h4 class="subsection">2.5.6 Packages Menu</h4>

<p>Using this menu you can have access to the list of packages and
data-sets installed on your system and to the ones on <acronym>CRAN</acronym> or on the
Bioconductor site.

   <p>With the first two menus you can load and detach packages and data-set
from the workspace.  Let's start with the <em>Package Manager</em>. This
opens a window with several columns displayed.  For each package on your
system you can see a check box, the current status of the package
(loaded/not loaded), its name and the package description text. You use
the check box to select/de-select the packages you want.  On window
closure, the checked packaged will be loaded and the unchecked ones (if
loaded) will the detached (not completely as on Mac OS X you cannot
unload completely dynamic libraries).

   <p>The same applies to the <em>Dataset Manager</em> menu but for data-sets.

   <p>You can than get or update packages <acronym>CRAN</acronym> either in binary or source
format. Daily build of <acronym>CRAN</acronym> packages are available for Mac OS X. If
you don't know how to build <acronym>R</acronym> itself from source, you'll probably be
unable to build packages from source on your own.  In this case, you
should always choose for the binary option. These binary packages work
(for sure!) for the release version of <acronym>R</acronym> for Mac OS X you find on
<acronym>CRAN</acronym> even though it is not excluded that they will work for other
prebuilt versions of <acronym>R</acronym>.

   <p>When you attempt to install packages from <acronym>CRAN</acronym>, <acronym>R</acronym> first tries to
get a connection to the Internet to download the list of available
packages. Than a window will open similar to the one in the package
manager with the only difference that for each package there is also the
information concerning the version of the package installed on your
system (if any) and the version of the prebuilt package available on
<acronym>CRAN</acronym>. When you close the window, the select packages will be
downloaded.

   <p>The same strategy applies to the Bioconductor menu item, with some more
options typical of the Bioconductor way of managing packages.

   <p>For some reason it could happen that you have the package you want to
install (either in binary or source form) on one of your local disks, or
even a directory containing a package source. You can use the last menu
to do the task of installing the package.  Having a package in a
directory form usually applies to people that are developing packages
themselves.

   <p>Note that packages which do not contain C, C++, Fortran <small class="dots">...</small> code
which needs to be compiled can be compiled from their sources with no
additional tools.

<h5 class="subsubsection">2.6.0.1 Startup</h5>

<p>The Drag &amp; drop section defines drag &amp; drop behaviour during R
start-up. Options are to open file in an editor or to source
file. Default is to source the file.  The Default Library Paths section
enables, on next start-up of R, to add a directory, e.g. 
<samp><span class="file">~/R/Library</span></samp>, to the library search/install path. The initial
working directory section can be used to enforce the initial working
directory. If no directory is specified, this directory is used as the
default. The Change button allows to select a new directory. The Always
apply selection will enforce the specified intial start-up
directory. The history section controls reading of the history file on
startup. If selected, R will read history file on start-up.  The R
history file field is used to read and store history from/to. This field
can be edited to allow selecting files starting with a period (e.g. 
<samp><span class="file">.Rapp.history</span></samp>). If you want the same history file regardless of
your selected working directory, specify a fixed path (e.g. 
<samp><span class="file">~/.Rapp.history</span></samp>).  The Default button will reset the history file
name to its default value. The History handling area allows setting of
the max number of entries to be kept in history, to remove duplicate
entries, to cleanup history entries (this is very useful to remove blank
lines when submitting multiple lines using Command-Return) and the strip
comments before the entry is added to the history.

editor. That editor will be used for all editing functions. It runs as a
separate application. Using an external editor means that R will never
wait while editing (e.g. <code>edit(A)</code> will return immediately and
open <code>A</code> in the external editor. Command-E and Command-Return like
functionality would need to be implemented by other means,
i.e. AppleScript. The external editor can be any application
(e.g. SubEthaEdit, TextWrangler, BBEdit, Smultron, etc) or can be
activated through a shell script (e.g. see or smultron, both give better
control on how to start the editor).

<p>GUI provides direct access/download/installation of packages located on
<acronym>CRAN</acronym>, the Bioconductor repositories or a custom repository. You can
also install packages from local files, either binary of source
packages, as explained below. Otherwise you can use the appropriate <acronym>R</acronym>
commands (see <code>install.packages</code>) to install packages from a
specific location other than the above mentioned ones.

<h3 class="section">3.2 Installation of packages</h3>

<p><acronym>R</acronym> for Mac OS X recognizes packages in two forms: <em>binary</em> packages and <em>source</em> packages.

   <p>Binary packages are <acronym>R</acronym> packages in ready-to-use form, such that no
additional tools are necessary for their use. Binary packages are
specific for a given <acronym>R</acronym> version and OS. <acronym>CRAN</acronym> and Bioconductor
repositories offer <acronym>R</acronym> packages in binary form for the last released
<acronym>R</acronym> version. Unlike on other Unix systems, R for Mac OS X installs
binary packages by default, i.e. <code>install.packages</code> will look for
binary repositories unless instructed otherwise.

   <p>Source packages are general in that they can be used on any platform and
OS supported by <acronym>R</acronym>, but they need to be processed and/or compiled
before they can be used. Additional tools may be necessary for that, see
see <a href="#Installation-of-source-packages">Installation of source packages</a> for details. For most users
binary packages are sufficient (if available and current).

   <p>On Mac OS X packages can be installed in three ways:

     <ul>
<li>Using <em>Package Manager</em> in the <span class="sc">R.app</span> GUI (recommended for most Mac users)

     <li>Using <code>install.packages</code> command in <acronym>R</acronym>

     <li>Using <code>R CMD INSTALL</code> command in the shell (aka <em>Terminal</em>)
</ul>

   <p>The latter two methods are common to all Unix systems and as such described in the general R documentation. In the following we will concentrate on using the <em>Package Installer</em>.

<p class="noindent">If you decide to install packages you should use the <em>Packages &amp; Data</em> menu of the GUI, in particular the sub-item <em>Package Installer</em>. Select the repository, package type (binary or source) and press <em>Get List</em>. This will connect to the repository through the Internet and a list all packages available for installation. The list tells you if a package is already installed on your system, the version of the package available on <acronym>CRAN</acronym> and the version of the same package if already installed.

<p class="noindent">You can use the search field to narrow the list of package to those matching your search criteria. Additionally you can use the search list menu to list only packages that are already installed on your system which is useful for comparing versions of available and installed packages. Finally, you can filter down to packages that have been installed by a previous <acronym>R</acronym> version as to allow a simple upgrade.

<p class="noindent">Select any package you want to install and press the <em>Install</em> button. You can follow the progress of the installation in the <acronym>R</acronym> Console. Once the required packages are installed, the list is re-loaded to reflect the versions of newly installed packages.

<p class="noindent">If you want to update all packages to the latest version, select the repository to use for the packages and press <em>Update All</em>. <acronym>R</acronym> will automatically determine the list of packages that can be updated and present you with a selection of packages to update.

<p class="noindent">You can also download any other package from the Internet yourself and decide to install it from source. In such case select one of the local entries
in the top left list and press the <em>Install</em> button (which is now enabled).

<p class="noindent">Packages can also be installed from other repositories by selecting <em>Other Repository</em> source. Enter the repository URL in the adjacent field. Note that currently the Package Installer assumes that custom repositories maintain proper hierarchy for both source and binary packages the same way <acronym>CRAN</acronym> does when using <em>Other Repository</em>. If your custom repository is flat, select <em>Other Directory URL</em> in the installation type list.

<h3 class="section">3.3 Installation of source packages</h3>

<p>Source packages which do not contain compiled code can (with rare
exceptions) be installed with no additional tools.

   <p>Packages with compiled code (or some with Unix scripts) need the tools
used to build <acronym>R</acronym> itself discussed in the `R Installation and
Administation Manual', and these will need to be in the `<samp><span class="samp">PATH</span></samp>' as
seen from <span class="sc">R.app</span> or command-line <acronym>R</acronym>.  For <span class="sc">R.app</span> you may need to add
e.g. <samp><span class="file">/usr/local/bin</span></samp> and it is usually most convenient to use
command-line <acronym>R</acronym>.

   <p>If using a CRAN binary install of <acronym>R</acronym> the compilers may not be in the
same place or have the same names as on the CRAN build machine.  Look at
file <samp><span class="file">/Library/Frameworks/R.framework/Resources/etc/Makeconf</span></samp>,
which will contain lines like
<pre class="example">     CC = gcc -arch x86_64 -std=gnu99
     CXX = g++ -arch x86_64
     CXXCPP = g++ -arch x86_64 -E
     FC = gfortran -arch x86_64
     F77 = gfortran -arch x86_64
     OBJC = clang -arch x86_64
     OBJCXX = clang++ -arch x86_64
</pre>
   <p class="noindent">You can either edit that file, or override settings in file
<samp><span class="file">~/.R/Makevars</span></samp>: see the section `Customizing package compilation'
of the `R Installation and Administration Manual'.

<h3 class="section">3.4 Where are the packages I've installed?</h3>

<p>The main library of packages is the one located inside the R.framework
(in <code>/Library/Frameworks/R.framework/Resources/library</code>). This
library contains the packages (base and recommended ones) distributed
along with <acronym>R</acronym>. Only administrators are allowed to install packages in
this system-wide directory. Note that this directory is
<acronym>R</acronym>-version-specific. Optionally users can install personal packages in
their <code>~/Library/R/x.y/library</code> directory where <code>x.y</code> denotes
the R version without the patch level (such as 3.0) &ndash; see the startup
preferences in <span class="sc">R.app</span>.

<p class="noindent">The Package Installer performs installation to either place depending on
the installation target setting. The default for an admin users is to
install packages system-wide, whereas the default for regular users is
their personal library tree.

<p class="noindent">If you use <code>install.packages</code> <acronym>R</acronym> function instead of
the Package Installer, the regular Unix behavior applies (see help pages
for details). For default setup this means that the packages are
installed according to the startup preference setting. You can check the
current defaults by issuing
<pre class="example">     .libPaths()

<h3 class="section">4.1 AppleScript support</h3>

<p><acronym>R</acronym> has partial support for Apple-Scripts.  At the moment <acronym>R</acronym> can be
invoked and asked to run commands from an AppleScript script.  What
follows is an example of script that interacts with <acronym>R</acronym>. It first
invokes <acronym>R</acronym> and then sends commands to <acronym>R</acronym> with the <samp><span class="command">cmd</span></samp>
applescript command.

<pre class="example">     set CommandLine to "R.Version()"
     try
     	tell application "R"
     		activate
     		with timeout of 90000 seconds
     			cmd CommandLine
     			cmd "Sys.getenv()"
     			cmd "print(\"HelloWorld!\")"
     		end timeout
     	end tell
     end try
</pre>
   <p class="noindent">In the above, <samp><span class="command">cmd</span></samp> is the (only) applescript command in the <acronym>R</acronym> dictionary that is
used to tell <acronym>R</acronym> to execute an <acronym>R</acronym> command in the R Console. The syntax is
<pre class="example">     cmd &lt;command string&gt;
</pre>
   <p>where command string have to be in quotes. Actually, the output of the command
is not sent back to the application that is calling <acronym>R</acronym> but to the <acronym>R</acronym> Console directly.

<p class="noindent">There are some issues. The first is that if <acronym>R</acronym> is still not running,
it will take a while (depending on how fast your machine is) to
startup. In the meanwhile the script sends commands without waiting and
it could happen that some commands are missed by <acronym>R</acronym>, i.e. they arrive
before <acronym>R</acronym> is ready to receive applescript commands. The second issue,
is that it could be that the applescript calls a bad version of
<acronym>R</acronym>. This could happen if you have an old version of <acronym>R</acronym> (for example
the old Carbon <acronym>R</acronym>) installed on your System.

<p class="noindent">As an example, we report here a small script that asks <acronym>R</acronym> to <samp><span class="command">source</span></samp> a file using a file dialog.
<pre class="example">     set file_to_source to (choose file with prompt "Choose file to source") as alias
     
     try
     	tell application "R"
     		activate
     		with timeout of 90000 seconds
     			cmd "source(\"" &amp; file_to_source &amp; "\")"
     		end timeout
     	end tell
     end try

<h3 class="section">4.2 External editors</h3>

<p><acronym>R</acronym> accepts the Apple Event command <em>open</em>. This means than an
external editor can communicate with <acronym>R</acronym> sending portions of <acronym>R</acronym> code
to execute via files. This is the approach used by the <acronym>R</acronym>-Tcl Mode in
Alpha X (see <a href="http://www.kelehers.org/alpha/">http://www.kelehers.org/alpha/</a>).

<h3 class="section">4.3 Finder actions</h3>

<p>Dragging a file on the <acronym>R</acronym> icon, causes <acronym>R</acronym> to source this file via
the <samp><span class="command">source</span></samp> <acronym>R</acronym> command or, if the file is an <acronym>R</acronym> image data
file RDX1 or RDX2 (normally files with extension <samp><span class="file">.rda</span></samp> or
<samp><span class="file">.RData</span></samp>), the data is loaded in the workspace and every object
with the same name in the workspace is overwritten without
notice. Loading a data file is equivalent to the <acronym>R</acronym> command
<samp><span class="command">load</span></samp>.  At the moment there is no control over the file types,
i.e. dragging wrong files (i.e. files that are not <acronym>R</acronym> scripts or image
data) simply gives an error. It is up to the user to <em>do the right
thing</em>.

<p class="noindent">If <acronym>R</acronym> is not yet running this action causes <acronym>R</acronym> to startup.

<h2 class="chapter">5 Quartz device</h2>

<p>The <code>quartz()</code> device is the native graphic device in R for Mac OS
X. Its name derives from Apple's Quartz Technology which is essentially
similar to PDF rendering.

   <p>The <code>quartz()</code> device can be used from <span class="sc">R.app</span> or a suitable build of <acronym>R</acronym>
running at the Mac console.  Where supported it is the default graphics
device.

via the <acronym>R</acronym> menu when the device window has focus.  This is a simple
way to export high quality graphics from <acronym>R</acronym> into other applications on
Mac OS X as graphics is PDF-based (so are almost all applications
available). For other solutions, see (see <a href="#Copying-the-image-into-the-clipboard">Copying the image into the clipboard</a>) and the <samp><span class="command">quartz.save</span></samp> function.

<p>You can copy the content of the quartz device window in the clipboard to
make the resulting image available for pasting into other
applications. The clipboard will contain both a PDF version and a bitmap
version of the quartz device window. Which version will be used depends
on the pasting applications, most modern application will prefer the PDF
version which is of higher quality as it supports vector graphics.

<h2 class="chapter">6 Tcl/Tk issues</h2>

<p>Each binary distribution of <acronym>R</acronym> available through <acronym>CRAN</acronym> is built to
use the X11 implementation of Tcl/Tk.  Of course a X windows server has
to be started first: this should happen automatically on OS X, provided
it has been installed (it needs a separate install on Mountain Lion and
later).  The first time things are done in the X server there can be a
long delay whilst a font cache is constructed; starting the server can
take several seconds.

   <p>Mac OS X 10.9 and higher no longer include X11
by default and it has to be obtained separately from
<a href="http://xquartz.macosforge.org">http://xquartz.macosforge.org</a>.

   <p>If you don't like the X11 style of widgets and use command-line <acronym>R</acronym> you
would probably want to build R using the Aqua version of Tcl/Tk (see the
`R Installation and Administration Manual'). Note, however, that such
builds do not work when used in the <span class="sc">R.app</span> GUI.

<h2 class="chapter">7 Internationalization of the R.app</h2>

<p><acronym>R</acronym> and the <span class="sc">R.app</span> GUI introduced support for internationalization in
R 2.1.0. Among other things this means that both messages and GUI
elements can be translated into various languages. <span class="sc">R.app</span> automatically
detects user's settings in the <em>International</em> section of the
System Preferences and uses that information to offer translated
messages and GUI if available. Please note that both <em>Language</em> and
<em>Formats</em> information is used so they should be set up
consistently.

   <p>If you use a non-standard setup (e.g. different language than
formats), you can override the auto-detection performed by setting
`<samp><span class="samp">force.LANG</span></samp>' defaults setting, such as for example
<pre class="example">     defaults write org.R-project.R force.LANG en_US.UTF-8
</pre>
   <p>when run in <em>Terminal</em> it will enforce US-english setting
regardless of the system setting. If you don't know what <em>Terminal</em>
is you can use this <acronym>R</acronym> command instead:
<pre class="example">     system("defaults write org.R-project.R force.LANG en_US.UTF-8")
</pre>
   <p>but do not forget to quit <acronym>R</acronym> and start <span class="sc">R.app</span> again
afterwards. Please note that you must always use `<samp><span class="samp">.UTF-8</span></samp>' version
of the locale, otherwise <span class="sc">R.app</span> will not work properly.

   <p>By default <span class="sc">R.app</span> uses UTF-8 for newly created documents and for the
console. When opening new documents <span class="sc">R.app</span> assumes UTF-8 and only if
the document violates UTF-8 rules, it will try to fallback to legacy
encoding, usually Mac Roman.

   <p>If you are interested in translating <span class="sc">R.app</span> GUI into other languages,
please read the developer documentation at
<a href="http://developer.r-project.org/Translations30.html">http://developer.r-project.org/Translations30.html</a>.

<h3 class="section">10.3 How can I interrupt lengthy operations or output?</h3>

<p>In <span class="sc">R.app</span> you can use the the <em>Stop</em> toolbar button or the &lt;ESC&gt; (escape) key in the console window to interrupt a running calculation or output.

   <p>For the command line version the same is achieved by pressing <kbd>&lt;Ctrl&gt;-c</kbd>. Both applications honor the <code>INT</code> signal, i.e. you can type the following in a separate Terminal window to cancel all R computations:
<pre class="example">     killall -INT R
</pre>
   <p>However, if the executed code does not check for interrupts (using `<samp><span class="samp">R_CheckUserInterrupt</span></samp>') there may be no way of stopping <acronym>R</acronym>. In that case it may be worth alerting the maintainer of the package to allow interruption (if appropriate).

<h3 class="section">10.4 I see spurious error messages when starting R!</h3>

<p>If you see error messages upon start of the R GUI which contain
<code>Library/InputManagers</code> anywhere in the text, then you have some
broken haxxies installed in your system. Those messages do NOT come from
<acronym>R</acronym>, so don't blame us. Bundles located in <code>Library/InputManagers</code>
of your home (or system) are hacks that get loaded into every Mac
application that you start. In most cases you don't see them crashing,
because most applications don't show the console output, but <acronym>R</acronym> does,
so all the errors those hacks are causing become visible. The easiest
remedy is to delete all offending bundles (possibly the whole
<code>Library/InputManagers</code> folder) and get a fixed version of the hack
(if you need it). The most common cause for broken hacks is system
updgrade (e.g. you get a new Mac and you transfer you settings which
include those hacks that are incompatible with your new Mac).

   <p>If you want to disable all external error output in the GUI, use
<pre class="example">     defaults write org.R-project.R 'Ignore stderr' YES
</pre>
   <p>in the Terminal. Note, however, that this will disable <em>all</em> error output from external programs including package installation or the <code>system</code> command.

<h3 class="section">10.5 Which BLAS is used and how can it be changed?</h3>

<p>The BLAS library used by <acronym>R</acronym> depends on the way <acronym>R</acronym> was compiled (see
`R Installation and Administration' manual for details). Current <acronym>R</acronym>
binaries supplied from <acronym>CRAN</acronym> provide both vecLib-based BLAS and
reference BLAS shipped with <acronym>R</acronym>. vecLib is a part of Apple's Accelerate
framework which provides an optimized BLAS implementation for Mac
hardware. Although fast, it is not under our control and may possibly
deliver inaccurate results.

   <p>The <acronym>CRAN</acronym> binary uses <code>--enable-BLAS-shlib</code> option and two Rblas
shared libraries are supplied: <samp><span class="file">libRblas.vecLib.dylib</span></samp> which uses
vecLib BLAS and <samp><span class="file">libRblas.0.dylib</span></samp> which uses reference BLAS from
<acronym>R</acronym>. A symbolic link <samp><span class="file">libRblas.dylib</span></samp> determines which one is
used. Currently the default is to use the <acronym>R</acronym> BLAS: this is recommended
for precision.

   <p>In order to change which BLAS is used, change the <samp><span class="file">libRblas.dylib</span></samp>
symlink correspondingly &ndash; for example in Terminal:
<pre class="example">     cd /Library/Frameworks/R.framework/Resources/lib
     
     # for vecLib use
     ln -sf libRblas.vecLib.dylib libRblas.dylib
     
     # for R reference BLAS use
     ln -sf libRblas.0.dylib libRblas.dylib
</pre>
   <p>This feature is only present in the <acronym>R</acronym> <acronym>CRAN</acronym> binary. Ordinarily
compiled <acronym>R</acronym> from sources will only have one of the above BLAS
libraries, corresponding to the configuration options used.

<h3 class="section">10.7 Why are there faint lines in image plots?</h3>

<p>When plots based on the <code>image()</code> function are exported to PDF,
Preview shows very faint grid lines at the edges of the rectangles that
create the image. Those lines are a rendering artifact in Preview coming
from the combination of anti-aliasing and sub-pixel rendering. They are
not really a part of the PDF (zooming in will reveal that they are not a
real object which would get larger with zoom) since the rectangles are
defined as a gapless coverage of the area. The effect can be
circumvented by disabling anti-aliasing in Preview.

   <p>We correct for this effect in Quartz when rendering on-screen by
snapping all rectangles to pixel boundaries of the screen, but Preview
does not.

   <p>The same effect occurs in any plot with adjacent, filled polygons
without border.

<h3 class="section">10.8 Why doesn't R GUI support keyboard shortcut XYZ ?</h3>

<p>The <span class="sc">R.app</span> GUI uses Apple frameworks for text editing and thus the
behavior of text views (console, editor, etc.) is consistent with other
applications and allows a very flexible customization. For example if
you are not satisfied with the default Emacs-like key bindings that Mac
OS X provides, Apple allows you to extend them arbitrarily. For more
details see Apple's documentation on
<a href="http://developer.apple.com/documentation/Cocoa/Conceptual/EventOverview/TextDefaultsBindings/chapter_9_section_2.html">Key Bindings</a>. There are also many 3rd-party pages on key bindings
customization, search for <code>StandardKeyBinding.dict</code>.

<p>The <acronym>CRAN</acronym> build of R is slightly different from a vanilla build of R,
i.e., a simple <code>./configure &amp;&amp; make &amp;&amp; make install</code>. The default
package type for all builds compiled from sources is <code>"source"</code>
wheres <acronym>CRAN</acronym> uses binary packages.  Only the <acronym>CRAN</acronym> build is
guaranteed to be compatible with the package binaries on <acronym>CRAN</acronym> (or
Bioconductor).

<h3 class="section">10.10 Why is R.home() in the R framework not versioned?</h3>

<p>In the command line version of R, <code>R.home()</code> always points to the
<code>Resources</code> directory symbolic link inside the R framework which
points to <code>Versions/Current/Resource</code> which is turn points to the
actual home &ndash; a versioned directory such as for example
<code>Versions/3.0/Resources</code>. This is how framework versioning works
in Mac OS X and is defined by Apple (see
<a href="http://developer.apple.com/documentation/MacOSX/Conceptual/BPFrameworks/Concepts/FrameworkAnatomy.html">Framework Anatomy</a>).

   <p>The advantage of this setup is that it is possible to install multiple R
versions in parallel and they all will be fully functional as long as
the <code>Current</code> symbolic link points to the currently used
version. There is even a small GUI utility <code>RSwitch</code> available from
the <a href="http://r.research.att.com/">R for Mac devel page</a> that allows
you to select the desired version. In addition, any application
embedding R can choose to use a specific R version (in most cases) or
any version.  Note that <span class="sc">R.app</span> is compiled against a particular version
of <acronym>R</acronym> and it may crash if <code>RSwitch</code> is used to change the version
of <acronym>R</acronym> in use.

   <p>Although it is possible to set <code>R_HOME</code> directly to the versioned
path in the R shell scripts (and thus be able to run different version
in parallel without changing the symbolic link), there are several
dangers lurking there so we don't recommend it. One problem is that
building packages from source won't work. The linker is always linking
against the current version of the framework and therefore only the
currently active version of R can compile packages. Further, packages
may have used the value of <code>R.home()</code> at install time and thus may
not work with incorrect setting.  Finally, if such an R start script
happens to get copied and the R version changes, it will stop working.

<h3 class="section">10.11 R.app GUI crashes on startup!</h3>

<p>If your <span class="sc">R.app</span> GUI crashes on startup, there are two common causes for
this: a saved workspace or a corrupted history file.  (Another is a
mismatch between <span class="sc">R.app</span> and <acronym>R</acronym> if either has been updated or
<samp><span class="command">RSwitch</span></samp> has been used.)

   <p>Saved workspaces can contain commands that implicitly load packages
which in turn can trigger bugs in packages or feed R with incorrect
starting values (especially if it was saved using another R). Try
removing or renaming your workspace &ndash; it's called <code>.RData</code>. If you
did not change your startup settings, you can e.g. use

<pre class="example">     mv ~/.RData ~/workspace.RData
</pre>
   <p>to move it aside and load later manually for inspection using <code>load("~/workspace.RData")</code>.

   <p>Second most common cause of crashes on startup is a history file that
was not created using the <span class="sc">R.app</span> GUI. Again, move it aside to see if
that's the issue: for the default file this could be done by

<pre class="example">     mv ~/.Rapp.history ~/history.txt
</pre>
   <p>Although we are trying to recover from invalid history files, they can
still crash <span class="sc">R.app</span> due to issues in the internal handling of strings in
Mac OS X. We are currently working on preventing this issue.

   <p>If you did both of the above and <span class="sc">R.app</span> still crashes, please select
`1' in the menu after the crash (if you get the crash menu in the
console) and send us the resulting crash report (see see <a href="#R_002eapp-Bugs">R.app Bugs</a>
above).

<p><span class="sc">R.app</span> will by default save the history in a <code>.Rapp.history</code> file

history is only used in subsequent <span class="sc">R.app</span> sessions and not command-line
<acronym>R</acronym>, and conversely.

   <p>Note that calling <code>savehistory()</code> in <span class="sc">R.app</span> does not currently
save the history of the <span class="sc">R.app</span> session: this means that
<code>history()</code> will show an empty window.

<h3 class="section">10.13 I get &ldquo;command not found&rdquo; in the GUI yet it works in the Terminal &ndash; why?</h3>

<p>When executing system commands (for example directly via <code>system</code> or indirectly via functions that call other programs such as <code>install.packages</code>) the locations in which the shell is looking for programs is governed by the <code>PATH</code> environment variable. That variable may be set differently for R started from an interactive shell and for R started in the GUI. You can use <code>Sys.getenv("PATH")</code> to verify the current setting.

   <p>When R is started from a shell (e.g., on the command line of the Terminal), it will inherit settings from that shell. Those are typically modified by shell-specific configuration files, such as <code>.profile</code> or <code>.bashrc</code>. Those apply only to the shell, not to the system as a whole. In addition, some installers (such as MacTeX) will modify global shell settings to make user's life more comfortable on the command line, but, again, those do not apply to programs not started from the shell &ndash; such as GUIs. See <a href="http://developer.apple.com/library/mac/#qa/qa1067">Apple Technical Q&amp;A QA1067</a> for what Apple says about the topic.

   <p>In order to standardize your <code>PATH</code> setting in R, you can set it in
your <code>.Renviron</code> file (in your home directory &ndash; see <code>?Startup</code>
in R for details on how R uses configuration files on startup). This
setting will apply to R regardless of how it is started. You can also
add more elaborate constructs to <code>.Rprofile</code> instead if you wish to
selectively modify the existing <code>PATH</code> variable via
<code>Sys.getenv</code> and <code>Sys.setenv</code>.

<h3 class="section">10.14 I see no text in a Quartz plot!</h3>

<p>Typically this means that you have corrupted fonts in your system. Open
the <code>Font Book</code> application (in <code>Applications</code>) and check the
fonts that you are using (for example the default font in Quartz is
currently &ldquo;Arial&rdquo;).  Corrupted fonts will have no glyphs (text will not
appear as it should), remove such fonts.
