# iNZightVIT Self Installer for Mac

This self-installing application is directed towards R users,
as it allows iNZight to install itself on any version of R (>= 3.0)
This assumes the following are installed:
- GTK+ 2.24-X11 (https://r.research.att.com/libs/GTK_2.24.17-X11.pkg)
- XQuartz (https://www.xquartz.org)
- R (>= 3.0) (https://www.r-project.org)

If you've had iNZight running previously, you'll already have the first two.


## Installation

1. First step is to copy the entire iNZightVIT folder to your Applications. It won't work from anywhere else.

2. Then double-click `iNZight` to launch it. It will automatically check for iNZight and install the necessary R packages, and then launch iNZight.


## Help

If you have any issues with the self installer, make sure you have GTK and XQuartz installed. You may need to restart your computer after doing so.
